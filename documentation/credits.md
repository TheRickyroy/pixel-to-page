## Code Credits

These credits include code snippets that has been used, or modified for use within _Pixel To Page_.\
In all cases the source of the code used is provided, although I have supplemented my learning with additional reading, research and personal coding practice to enure that I was able to understand the code as oppose to simply copy and pasting code. Much of this can be found within [Additional Research](documentation/research.md).
