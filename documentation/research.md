## Color

### Color Space

>Personally, I'm using HSL. In the coming months, I plan on migrating to OKLCH, but it feels just a bit too bleeding-edge at the moment.

> [Josh W Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/color-formats/)

> But, that being said, OKLCH comes with two challenges:
>
> With OKLCH and LCH, not all combinations of L, C, and H will result in colors that are supported by every monitor. Although browsers will try to find the closest supported color, itâ€™s still safer to check colors using our color picker.
>
>OKLCH is a new color space. At the time of this writing in 2024, its ecosystem is still limited (for Figma we have the plugin but not official support), but we already have a palette generator, color picker, and many converters.
