## Python Validation

Validation of Python Code was performed using the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) as provided by Code Institute.

#### Settings: Test 1

Upon initially testing my **settings.py** file I found a number of minor errors that required correction.\
This included:
- E111 indentation is not a multiple of 4
- E501 line too long (85 > 79 characters)
- W291 trailing whitespace
- E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
- E122 continuation line missing indentation or outdented
- E501 line too long
- W292 no newline at end of file

These were generally simple fixes that had resulted from copy/paste or auto linting being set incorrectly to use two space tab.\
I did however find myself slightly unsure how to reduce an overlength line after already using a continuation line.\
During stand up (2024-12-03) I asked Amy (learning facilitator) about this and was informed it was a non-issue and out of scope for the proejct.

As a follow up, Amy provided additional resources:
- Python.org - [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#indentation)
- Datacamp - [A Comprehensive Guide on How to Line Break in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/how-to-line-break-in-python)

Using these resources for further supplemental learning I intend to return and fix this issue once my MVP deliverables have been achieved.

### Virtual Test Environment

Using [statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats) to attain the latest (_October 2024_) usage stats, I compiled a virtual testing environment using [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en) with the six most popular worldwide screen resolutions. Although the most popular resolution globally is **1920x1080**, the [data](https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet) shows usage stats for **61.63% - Mobile**, **36.52% - Desktop** and the remaining **1.85% - Tablet**, thus reinforcing a mobile first approach to responsive design and UX.

| Rank | Resolution | Global Usage |
| :--: | :--: | --: |
| 1 | 1920x1080 | 9.24% |
| 2 | 350x800 | 6.77% |

## Bugs

This being my first Full Stack Project, I anticipated running into bugs and issues throughout the process.\
Though they caused difficulties at times, they have also offered up ample learning opportunity for debugging and grasping a better understanding of the core concepts and implementations required for developing a project such as _Pixel To Page_.

As part of my learning experience, and for future reference, I chose to fully document all bugs encountered and the steps taken during the debugging process.\
By doing so I hope to continue developing my understanding and thus increase my efficiency by having effective solutions to refer back to, but just as importantly, failed solutions to potentially avoid in future. 

### Bug Status

This table can be used to identify all bugs throughout the project including their solution status.\
Additional details about each bug, including screenshots, resolution steps and potential future solutions can be found [here](#bugs---additional-detail).

### Bugs - Additional Detail

<details><summary>Bug #1 - Database Migration - Syntax Error</summary>

Commit [ef4ef38](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/ef4ef3867d31ea2762afa447bfe4ef8849102eb9)

After attempting to migrate the database I received an indentation error within the terminal. 
This was the result of pasting the required code from the Django Setup & Deployment document and it losing the correct indentation in the process. 

`Indentation Error: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 16`

![Bash Terminal Error](../documentation/images/bugs/bug-1.webp)

Thanks to the terminal identifying this error it was a simple fix adding the correct indentation of two spaces on line 17 and repeating the migration command.

`python3 manage.py migrate`

<details><summary>Bug #2 - Database Migration - Syntax Error</summary>

Commit [ef4ef38](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/ef4ef3867d31ea2762afa447bfe4ef8849102eb9)

Following the debugging of Bug #1 the bach terminal returned an additional syntax error. 

This was a rogue `-` on line 43 of **settings.py** which was accidentally typed in whilst making notes on the deployment process for the **README** docs whilst the IDE Workspace was still my active window. 

</details>

<details><summary>Bug #3 - Heroku Application Error</summary>

Commit [f1efeb0](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/f1efeb0e2f6fe703e79bf5fdab7953d8ed85f6ce)

Application error returned upon deploying the app in Heroku.
![Heroku Application Error](../documentation/images/bugs/bug-3-1.webp)

Attempted to run server from IDE thus identifying error in terminal
![Run Server Error](../documentation/images/bugs/bug-3-2.webp)

Corrected cloudinary environ in **env.py** file after incorrect copy and paste from API & Heroku.

I also updated method to `setdefaul()` as oppose to assigning the value as per LMS.
![Set Default](../documentation/images/bugs/bug-3-3.webp)

Before submitting a support request I checked through the channel and found another student had already sought out a solution which reminded me to set `DEBUG = True` as it was still set to False from my deployment attempt. 

After double checking through all steps I also realised I had missed a step in adding to the **blog** **views.py**

During the debugging process I also identified Bug #4 which was resolved prior to this bug closure.

<details><summary>Bug #4 - Procfile Syntax</summary>

Commit [aa63bd6](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/aa63bd6bd083caf5125419e8955d9354af4d07c8)

Project name identified to be using wrong sytnax in **Procfile** as part of Bug #3 debugging process.

Incorrect - `web: gunicorn pixel-to-page.wsgi`\
Correct - `web: gunicorn pixel_to_page.wsgi`

<details><summary>Bug #5 - Commit Push Failure</summary>

Commit [923e65f](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/923e65fcb58a6436f1f6540841b7aac3c78fe630)

**Identification**

Discussion during guided session highlighted **runtime.txt** requirement absent from the walkthrough documentation, but present within the LMS.

Upon creation of this file I attempted a `git add .` `git commit` and `git push` at which point I received an error in the terminal.

**Resolution**

`git pull main`
```
fatal: 'main' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

`git pull`
```
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before

<details><summary>Bug #6 - Admin Panel Access</summary>

Commit [a3ddfb1](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/a3ddfb1d34ea27d541b7b9f8dbd2b0849b64d204)

**Identification**

Upon adding the post view I was unable to access the admin panel.

**Solution**

I checked through my files and code and realised that **pixel_to_page** > **urls.py** required `path('admin/', admin.site.urls),` moving prior to `path("", include("blog.urls"), name="blog-urls"),`. 

Doing this resolved the issue and granted access to admin again within my development workspace. 

</details>

<details><summary>Bug #7 - Post Title Links</summary>

Commit [a3ddfb1](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/a3ddfb1d34ea27d541b7b9f8dbd2b0849b64d204)

**Identification**
After rectifying the admin panel in bug #6 I found to I was unable to access the **post_detail** view via the title hyperlink.

**Solution**
Upon inspection of **index.html** I realised I had the original `<href>` was still in place preventing correct linking. 

Incorrect Code
```
<a href="{% url 'post_detail' post.slug %}" class="post-link"></a>
	<a href="#" class="post-link">
	<h2 class="card-title">{{ post.title }}</h2>
</a>
```

Corrected Code 
```
<a href="{% url 'post_detail' post.slug %}" class="post-link">
	<h2 class="card-title">{{ post.title }}</h2>
</a>
```

<details><summary>Bug #8 - Comment Including HTML</summary>

Commit - [630d636](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/630d63681624cd2e2e5498e50523a58d3cbf9ee9)

**Identification**
Upon testing the comment CRUD functionality the body of the content included additional HTML code that was used to provide structure to the layout within the admin panel.

![bug 8](images/bugs/bug-8.webp)

**Resolution**
Amended code from including linebreaks to safe. 

Incorrect code
```
<div id="comment{{ comment.id }}">
  {{ comment.body | linebreaks }}
</div>
```

```
<div id="comment{{ comment.id }}">
  {{ comment.body | safe }}
</div>
```

This solution was provided by Mark Briscoe during an SME (subject matter expert) open door coding session (2024-12-02).

<details><summary>Bug #9 - Terminal Command Overwriting</summary>

**Identification**

Whilst typing the commit message for Bug #8 the bash terminal would begin overtyping the start of the line.

![bug 9](images/bugs/bug-9.webp)

**Solution**

- First Attempt - Retyping the command - produced the same result.
- Second Attempt - Starting a new bash terminal and retyping the command. - Resolved issue.

<details><summary>Bug #10 - Blog Link Active State</summary>

Commit [af42261](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/)

**Identification**

Whilst adding base styling to **style.css** and adjusting for the Booststrap auto styles, I realised that the active link styling was not applying to the **Blog** link. 

Active link styling applying to **Home**\
![bug-10-1](images/bugs/bug-10-1.webp)

Active link styling not applied to **Blog**\
![bug-10-2](images/bugs/bug-10-2.webp)

**Solution**

After debug testing of styles for nav classes (due to prior experience struggling to override Bootstrap) I realised that the issue may be with the link and not the styling. At this point I noticed that the link wasn't being called at the head of the page and quickly resolved the issue with the addition of the required code.\

Code add
``` Python
{% url 'blog' as blog_url %}
```

<details><summary>Bug #11 - Deployed CSS Styling</summary>

Commit - [4a38412](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/4a384126a85f6ed7d9b680af36c193496658f90e)
Commit - [9c4d1de](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/9c4d1deeb09a9b67d4b6e9dec8accf03b6829903)

**Identification**

Merged changes from **style** branch into **main** performed pull request and deployed to Heroku. 
Upon deployment the CSS styling was not being applied although it was present within the IDE workspace. 

CSS Styling - IDE Workspace
![bug-11-1](images/bugs/bug-11-1.webp)

No CSS Styling - Deployed Heroku Project
![bug-11-2](images/bugs/bug-11-2.webp)

**Initial debugging steps taken:**

- Ensuring DEBUG was set to false (it was)
- Redeploying the project to Heroku
- Checking Heroku config files
- Testing across various devices and broswers
- Testing as registered and unregistered users
- Reaching out to CI Coding Coaches in Slack channel

**Solution steps with Roo MacArthur:**

- Confirmed Heoku status as above
- Redeployed & observed build logs
- Opened redeployed app
  - Dev Tools > Network > [X] Disable cache
	- View Source > Inspect CSS 
    - Confirmed it was using a previous version
  - Also checked app after hard refresh and within incognito window

- Staged current branch changes for commit & push (my working local branch **style**)
- Performed collect static on local **main**
- Confirmed that **static > style.css** was not being collected into **staticfiles > style.css**
- Created **base.css** to test whether it would be collected
- Confirmed this file was collected
- Renamed **style.css > style1.css** 
- Created new **style.css** and copied across code
- Collected static files
- Confirmed new **style.css** was collected / updated
  -  At this point the renames **style1.css** was also collected
- Resolved divergent branches caused during debugging process
- Push out to remote
- Redeploy on Heroku
- Confirmed deployment had updated styling applied

Discussion regarding the cache functionality and process as a developer.\
Roo confirmed with chatGPT that the Gitpod IDE workspace was maintaining a cached version of static files. 

Provided commands to run to ensure the latest version of static files are being populated within the workspace.

`python manage.py collectstatic --clear`\
`python manage.py collectstatic`

<details><summary>Bug #12 - Footer Position</summary>

Commit - [e04fdb9](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/e04fdb9c7d652469b8658a37031875ac70db079f)

**Identification**

Whilst appliying styling the footer position was incorrect on the **About** page, and thus across any page without content beyond the view height. 

Footer Incorrect
![bug-12-1](images/bugs/bug-12-1.webp)

Footer Correct
![bug-12-2](images/bugs/bug-12-2.webp)

Though I have previously solved this on other projects, I sought out additional solutions in hope of learning a more effective method.\
Following the steps provided by Rodu - [How to Make Footer Stay at Bottom of Page with Bootstrap](https://radu.link/make-footer-stay-bottom-page-bootstrap/) I was able to implement a shorter and cleaner code solution. 

Body Classes
`<body class="d-flex flex-column min-vh-100 main-bg">`

Footer Class
`<footer class="mt-auto">`

Debug process for this was started on **docs** branch after performing merge main following Bug #11 pull request.
To avoid conflicts I continued the debug and application of styling whilst on this same branch.

**Initial debugging steps taken:**

- Checked **admin.py**, **models.py** and **views.py** reflected the addition of slug to category model.
- Attempted debugging steps and searching previous solutions within Slack.
- Used Perplexity.AI to help provide non-code based diagnose and guidance for potential debugging steps.
- Reached out within Slack Coding Coach

**Solution steps with Roo MacArthur:**

- Roo provdied updated slug that hadn't been implemented within **base.html**\
`{% url 'post_detail' post.category.slug post.slug %}`

- I realised at this point that I hadn't actually run the migration since the addition of slug to category and that this would cause an issue and suggested zeroing out the data. 

Slack Conversation
![bug-13-2](images/bugs/bug-13-2.webp)

- At this point Roo and I joined a VC call to discuss the solution process. 
- Attempted to run migration knowing it would fail, more as a debug step for learning.
- Migration was unable to complete due to the lack of default for previously assigned object data. 
- This took us into a discussion regarding improved working practices, using the **db.sqlite3** as part of the development workspace and maintaining the **postgreSQL** for production only. 
- As a result of this debugging process, and to further my learning of improved practices I;
  - Deleted all current migrations as part of the **blog** app
  - Performed `python manage.py migrate blog zero` (although redundant due to next step, this was more for practice)
  - Setup a fresh **postgreSQL** database, linked in **env.py** and Heroku
  - Began working on the **db.sqlite3** within development workspace
