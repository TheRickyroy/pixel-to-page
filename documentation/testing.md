## Virtual Test Environment

Using [statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats) to attain the latest (_October 2024_) usage stats, I compiled a virtual testing environment using [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en) with the six most popular worldwide screen resolutions. Although the most popular resolution globally is **1920x1080**, the [data](https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet) shows usage stats for **61.63% - Mobile**, **36.52% - Desktop** and the remaining **1.85% - Tablet**, thus reinforcing a mobile first approach to responsive design and UX.

| Rank | Resolution | Global Usage |
| :--: | :--: | --: |
| 1 | 1920x1080 | 9.24% |
| 2 | 350x800 | 6.77% |
| 3 | 375x812 | 4.63% |
| 4 | 390x844 | 4.49% |
| 5 | 1366x768 | 4.28% |
| 6 | 1536x864 | 4.15% |

### Bugs - Additional Detail

<details><summary>Bug #1 - Database Migration - Syntax Error</summary>

Commit [ef4ef38](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/ef4ef3867d31ea2762afa447bfe4ef8849102eb9)

After attempting to migrate the database I received an indentation error within the terminal. 
This was the result of pasting the required code from the Django Setup & Deployment document and it losing the correct indentation in the process. 

`Indentation Error: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 16`

![Bash Terminal Error](../documentation/images/bugs/bug-1.webp)

Thanks to the terminal identifying this error it was a simple fix adding the correct indentation of two spaces on line 17 and repeating the migration command.

`python3 manage.py migrate`

<details><summary>Bug #2 - Database Migration - Syntax Error</summary>

Commit [ef4ef38](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/ef4ef3867d31ea2762afa447bfe4ef8849102eb9)

Following the debugging of Bug #1 the bach terminal returned an additional syntax error. 

This was a rogue `-` on line 43 of **settings.py** which was accidentally typed in whilst making notes on the deployment process for the **README** docs whilst the IDE Workspace was still my active window. 

</details>

<details><summary>Bug #3 - Heroku Application Error</summary>

Commit [f1efeb0](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/f1efeb0e2f6fe703e79bf5fdab7953d8ed85f6ce)

Application error returned upon deploying the app in Heroku.
![Heroku Application Error](../documentation/images/bugs/bug-3-1.webp)

Attempted to run server from IDE thus identifying error in terminal
![Run Server Error](../documentation/images/bugs/bug-3-2.webp)

Corrected cloudinary environ in **env.py** file after incorrect copy and paste from API & Heroku.

I also updated method to `setdefaul()` as oppose to assigning the value as per LMS.
![Set Default](../documentation/images/bugs/bug-3-3.webp)

Before submitting a support request I checked through the channel and found another student had already sought out a solution which reminded me to set `DEBUG = True` as it was still set to False from my deployment attempt. 

After double checking through all steps I also realised I had missed a step in adding to the **blog** **views.py**

During the debugging process I also identified Bug #4 which was resolved prior to this bug closure. 

</details>

<details><summary>Bug #4 - Procfile Syntax</summary>

Commit [aa63bd6](https://github.com/TheRickyroy/pixel-to-page/commit/aa63bd6bd083caf5125419e8955d9354af4d07c8)

Project name identified to be using wrong sytnax in **Procfile** as part of Bug #3 debugging process.

Incorrect - `web: gunicorn pixel-to-page.wsgi`\
Correct - `web: gunicorn pixel_to_page.wsgi`
