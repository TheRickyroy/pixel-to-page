- `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Click on **Open in new browser**.
- A new browser tab should open containing the Django project.
- Copy the INVALID HTTP_HOST header displayed on this page `'8000-therickyroy-pixeltopage-pqpue43ydq5.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net'`
<br><br>

6. Navigate to **settings.py** in the IDE File Explorer.

- Update the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include what was copied in the previous step and `'.herokuapp.com'`.
``` Python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['8000-therickyroy-pixeltopage-pqpue43ydq5.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net', 
                '.herokuapp.com']
```
<br>

7. Immediately below the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` add the following code to ensure your IDE and Heroku pass CSRF verification.

``` Python
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    "https://*.codeinstitute-ide.net",
    "https://*.herokuapp.com"
]
```

<p align="right"><a href="#">🔺 Back To Top</a></p><hr>

### Django App

1. Create your app assigning an appropriate name in lowercase, in this example our app is **blog**.

- This will create a your new app folder & file structure. 

```
python3 manage.py startapp blog
```
<br>

2. Navigate to **settings.py** and add your new app to `INSTALLED_APPS`

- _Note:_ Other apps removed for brevity.

``` Python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'blog',
]
```
<br>

3. Save all files.

<p align="right"><a href="#">🔺 Back To Top</a></p><hr>

## Heroku

1. Navigate to your [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
<br><br>

2. Create a new app.
- Click **New**.
- Click **Create new app** from the drop-down menu.
- Give it a unique name (for this project `pixel-to-page`).
- Select the appropriate region (for this project `Europe`).
<br><br>

3. Disabling collection of static files.
- Navigate to app settings .
- Click **Reveal Config Vars**.
- Add a new Config var.
	- Key = `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`
	- Value = `1`
- Click **Add**.
<br><br>

4. Install the web server gunicorn and freeze requirements.

```
pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1
```

```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
<br>

5. Create a new Procfile in the root directory.
- **IMPORTANT** Ensure correct capitalisation of P for Heroku to correctly identify the file.
<br><br>

6. Declare the process in Procfile.

```
web: gunicorn pixel-to-page.wsgi
```
<br>

7. Add deployed app to allowed hosts.
- This stage was already covered by adding `'.herokuapp.com'`  in step 6 of the initial Django setup process.
<br><br>

8. Connect to GitHub Repo.
- Navigate to **Deploy** tab.
- In Deployment method, select **GitHub: Connect to GitHub**.
- Search for your project repo and click **Connect**.
<br><br>

9. Spcify Eco Dynos for resource usage.
- Navigate to the **Resources** tab.
- Ensure your app is using Eco Dynos supplied as part of [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) (see [LMS](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/dashboard) for further details).
- Remove any Postgres DB Add-ons (this should already be empty).

<p align="right"><a href="#">🔺 Back To Top</a></p>

## PostgreSQL

### Creating Your Database

1. Navigate to [CI Database Maker](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/).

2. Input your email address and follow the instructions provided.

3. Open the received email and copy your database URL.

### Connecting to Your Database

1. Install Database Packages & freeze the requirements.

```
pip3 install dj-database-url~=0.5 psycopg
```

```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

- **Note:** If you have not closed your workspace you can navigate to the previous command to freeze the requirements using the up arrow in the terminal.
<br><br>

2. In the root directory create an **env.py** file.
<br><br>

3. Add `env.py` to  the **.gitignore** file.

- **Note:** This may already be added within the file.
<br><br>

4. Import os library to **env.py** and set the environment variables pasting in the URL provided by in your CI Database Maker email.

``` Python
import os
```

``` Python
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in PostgreSQL database URL"
```
<br><br>

5. Add in a secret key.

``` Python
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"
```

- You can use a generator such as [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/) to construct a secure key for you.
- **IMPORTANT** Be sure your key does not contain quotations that may conflict with your syntax.
<br><br>

In **Heroku**

1. Navigate to the **Settings** > **Config Vars**

- Add your secret key
	- Key = `SECRET_KEY,`
	- Value = `The secret hey generated in previous step`

- Add your Database URL 
	- Key = `DATABASE_URL`
	- Value = `The URL provided by the CI Database Maker`
<br><br>

In **settings.py**

1. Update the file to include the following directly beneath `from pathlib import Path`

``` Python
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
import env
```
<br>

2. Remove the insecure secret key that was previously generated and replace with the following code
``` Python
os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
```
<br>

3. Comment out the old Database section code

``` Python
# DATABASES = {
#     'default': {
#         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
#     }
# }
```

- **NOTE:** Highlight all code and use **CTRL + /** (On Windows) to comment out all lines together
<br><br>

4. Add new Databases section linking to the variable on Heroku 

``` Python
DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```

### Migrating Your Database

1. Save all files. 

2. Make your migrations.

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
